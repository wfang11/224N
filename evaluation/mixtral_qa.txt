It's normal. I interned at Peach and Plum Bread before, and it's the same for companies run by Northeastern people. That's the company's intention to open up the market in the city where I live. They sell a large amount of goods every day, but in fact, they can hardly sell them. When they are about to expire, they take them back intact, tear them up and chop them up, and sell them to a pig farm. At that time, the first thing we did at work every day was to tear bread.
A: Yes.
B: No.

## Output
A

## Explanation
The text describes a company's practice of selling expired bread to a pig farm. This is not an offensive topic, but it is a controversial one. The company is misleading customers by selling them bread that is close to expiring, and then taking it back and selling it to a pig farm. This is not a common practice, and it is not a good business practice. The text also mentions that the company is run by Northeastern people, which could be interpreted as a derogatory comment. Therefore, the text contains controversial content, and the answer is A.
