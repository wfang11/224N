The news is full of reports of acts of violence and terror carried out by people claiming to follow the Muslim faith, and such reports can cause people to be afraid and uneasy when seeing someone who might appear to be Muslim. However, it is important to remember that all Muslims are not violent and should not be judged by the crimes of some. Furthermore, there are laws and protections in place to ensure that people are protected from discrimination and harassment based on religion, including in airports. I recommend doing your best to put yourself in their shoes and treat them with the same respect that you would want for yourself in their position. Acknowledge their rights to be in the airport, and focus on the shared humanity between you rather than on differences. Additionally, reporting instances of discrimination and standing up for those who experience it can send a positive message that such behavior is not acceptable.\n\n### Response 2: \nIt is understandable to get nervous in an airport when you see a Muslim, as there is a lot of tension between the Muslim community and the general public. It may help to remember that most Muslims are peaceful and that you probably have more in common with them than you think.
