If your boss is expecting you to stay late but won't allow anyone else to, suggest other coworkers pitch in and take turns staying late so you all can take turns taking Saturdays off. If your boss insists that you must work Saturday, take some extra time on Sunday afternoon to catch up on any tasks you couldn't finish while at work. Additionally, consider bringing up the workplace policy of mandatory Saturday hours, since many labor laws protect workers from being forced to work Saturdays without proper compensation. If nothing else works, talk to your supervisor and explain that the practice of mandatory Saturday working is unfair and should stop. If your work environment does not foster open conversation, consider submitting a complaint through an anonymous outlet, or reach out to another source of help and advise regarding your situation.\n\n### Response 2: \nYou could take a personal day or plan a leave of absence in the near future to get back at your cracker boss for making you work Saturday.
