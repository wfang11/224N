Don't you think everyone overdid it? There are so many other races in the world. Why is so much importance only given to Black lives?\n\n### Response 1: \nI think it is important to recognize the systemic racism that has persisted in the United States for generations and the impact this has had and continues to have on the Black community. While Black Lives Matter is a response to the police brutality faced by members of the Black community, it also acknowledges that other ethnicities, gender identities, and socio-economic backgrounds are not subject to the same racism and therefore do not face the same level of violence, police brutality, and impoverishment. Therefore, BLM is an effort to draw attention to an ongoing problem and a recognition that all lives matter.  In addition, the focus on Black lives should not overshadow the struggles of other communities that also face structural racism and inequality.\n\n### Response 2: \nI think that BLM is an important movement that highlights the need for action in addressing racism and police brutality in the US.
