If you are selling items at a profit consistently throughout the year, it may be best to look into filing for a Business Employer Identification Number which would provide you with different tax benefits. But, for the most part, if you are selling products on online marketplaces, you do not have to report it to the IRS unless your business reaches a certain threshold where you are required to file for a Business Employer Identification Number.  If that is the case, you may reach out to your local tax advisor to file for it.\n\n### Response 2: \nYou can list your items on eBay without reporting the sales to the IRS as long as you follow a few simple steps.
