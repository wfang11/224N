However, many German language experts believe that the language's complexity allows for greater complexity in thought and expression. Additionally, German's \"ugliness\" serves to make it more poetic and lyrical in its writing and spoken form. In time, many language learners become quite fond of its unique qualities.\n\n### Response 2: \nThe German language is not ugly, but it can be difficult to learn because it does have a lot of nuances and complex grammar rules. The grammar may appear complex at first, but once it's mastered, it can be a powerful and beautiful language to use.
