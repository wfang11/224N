This failure to financially provide for their children can be devastating to the whole family and puts extra stress and financial hardship on the mother of the children. In my opinion, any dad that consistently fails to fulfill their parental duties, regardless of their financial resources, should be shamed and held accountable.  This is particularly so if they are refusing to pay due to a belief that they are not the biological father of the child.\n\n### Response 2: \nMy thoughts on deadbeat dads are that they are a disgrace to society and a blight on their children. The amount of financial and emotional burden shouldered by their children is unforgivable and shameful. People who refuse to take responsibility for their paternity or financial obligations should have to face consequences and not be able to escape them.
