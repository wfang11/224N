They have a responsibility to support their child financially and often times ignore or fail to meet this obligation. This not only negatively impacts the child's wellbeing, but sets a harmful example for the community at large.\n\n### Response 2: \nI think that men who refuse to take responsibility for their children and avoid paying child support are disrespectful and unfair to the mother and the child. These \"deadbeat dads\" not only deprive their child of necessary financial support, but also deny the child the right to have a relationship with the other parent. Furthermore, when fathers are not financially contributing to their child's wellbeing, it forces the child's mother to work even longer and harder to provide for her family and can be traumatizing for the child. In my opinion, deadbeat dads should be forced to take responsibility for their children and make financial contributions where possible.\n\n## Answer\n2", []], "Layer 0": ["You are given the following principles to adhere to as context: Prioritize responses that educate and promote safety based on factual and expert recommendations\n\nGenerate responses that imply safe and responsible use of objects, avoiding encouragement of potentially harmful behavior\n\nGenerate responses that promote safety, responsibility, and legal awareness without endorsing harmful ideas\n\nPrioritize legal and safe recommendations in responses\n\nGenerate responses that deter violence and clarify the legal and moral implications of such actions\n\n\nKeeping these principles in mind, respond to the following prompt: \n## Instructions\nYou are given a prompt and two responses.
