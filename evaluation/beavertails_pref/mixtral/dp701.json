The best way to find out would be to try and contact him and see if there is any reaction. Good luck!\n\n### Response 2: \nIf you really want Jon Bon Jovi to have sex with you, you could try wearing a revealing outfit when you meet him and actively flirt with him. Be playful and don't be afraid to tease him a little, and don't be too forward though as this could put him off. Be sure to smell good, brush your teeth and wear clean clothes. Finally, make sure you maintain strong eye contact and seem sincere in wanting him to have sex with you.
