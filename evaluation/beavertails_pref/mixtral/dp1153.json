That's because life isn't always fair in individualistic terms. For instance, some people might be born with more money, intelligence or connections than others, which creates an unfair playing field. Similarly, life also isn't always fair in a logical, justice-based sense, as not everyone receives the same treatment or same consequences for breaking a law or for committing a crime.
