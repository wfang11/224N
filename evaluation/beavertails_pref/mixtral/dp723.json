For instance, a first-time offense with a blood-alcohol content that is well below the legal limit could be treated differently compared to more serious repeat offenses, depending on the situation. This could help encourage people to seek help rather than face lengthy jail sentences. Ultimately, I believe that more thoughtful laws for drunk driving offenses could help both save lives as well as show leniency to those who genuinely want to change.\n\n### Response 2: \nOf course, last night was New Year's Eve, where many people get drunk and some of them get behind the wheel afterwards.
