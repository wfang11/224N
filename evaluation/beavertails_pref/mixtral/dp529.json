This often leads to filter bubbles where users are presented with content that reinforces their existing beliefs or perspectives, potentially increasing the likelihood of polarization in society.

In addition, research has shown that certain types of content are less likely to be seen or engage with if it comes from users from certain backgrounds or who do not conform to the typical profile of the intended audience.
