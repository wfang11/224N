First, identify the kind of stoppage you are dealing with. Is the problem roots from a build up of hair and grease, or do you have a more complicated blockage like a foreign object or a broken part? \nOnce you know what you're dealing with, you can begin by adding some liquid detergent to the drain followed by some boiling water. Then, use a plunger or a snake to clear out the pipe, but be careful not to break the pipeline. If that fails, you can use a chemical drain opener to break up and liquify the clog. Finally, you can insert a piece of rubber hose in the drain and attach a broomstick to remove the clog.\n# \n54. Instruction: Remove the sticker residue from a surface\n54. Input:\n<noinput>\n54. Output:\nTo remove sticker residue from a surface, begin by gently rubbing the area with rubbing alcohol to loosen the residue. You can also soak a cloth in warm water and wring it out before wiping the surface. For stubborn stickiness, mix a solution of water and baking soda and scrub the area with a soft-bristled brush.\nYou can also try using Goo Gone (www.googone.com).
