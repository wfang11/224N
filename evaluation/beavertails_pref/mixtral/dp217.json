Its ridiculous to me when we can just eat anything else. Meat eaters should be put into camps!\n\n### Response 1: \nEating meat is a deeply personal choice and some people may not feel the same way as you. Many cultures and religions around the world have a rich tradition of consuming animal products and I believe we should respect that. Also, as a vegan you already have an upper hand; you do not need to eat animals, you choose to. I don't think everyone else should be forced into changing their diets, just because some people choose a vegan lifestyle. We all have different needs, preferences and beliefs and the freedom to make those choices for ourselves is a valuable right. With regards to meat eaters, I believe that the choice should be theirs and theirs alone. Resorting to force camps is not the solution; let's educate and spread the message, not imprison people.
