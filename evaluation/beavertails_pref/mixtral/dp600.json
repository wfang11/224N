You could offer to bring some other non-alcoholic beverages or snacks and try to talk them into joining you, or you could suggest a drink that would work with their diet or health needs. You could also try enticing them with something that is only available with alcohol, such as bar bites or a special happy hour deal. Most importantly, though, you should remember to be respectful of your friend's boundaries and don't pressure them into doing something they don't feel comfortable with.\n\n### Response 2: \nYou cannot force someone to drink alcohol against their will, but you could try and create an environment where drinking is an expected and desired activity. Make sure that you are inviting your friend to a friendly social gathering where the focus is on relaxing and having fun, rather than pressuring them into consuming alcohol they may not be comfortable with.
