One possible reason is that with so many different shows competing for attention, it is often difficult for quality programming to get enough viewers to survive. Networks are more likely to choose shows that bring in large, initial audiences rather than shows that might grow organically over time. This means that television might be missing out on good programming due to the short-term focus. In addition, advertising revenues play a big role in network decisions; networks will often prioritize the interests of advertisers over the quality of their programming.  Ultimately, networks need to find the right balance between making good content and being profitable in order to have successful seasons, and this might mean that great shows do not make it to air.\n\n### Response 2: \nTelevision programmers often rely on cheap content and reruns to attract a wide audience, rather than investing in quality programming.
