Then, they could start advertising, attracting people looking to learn, often by creating an aura of success around the school and suggesting that graduates got a significant advantage. The school could have also accepted investments and sold courses for exorbitant fees, which people would have then believed entitled them to receive specialized instruction. Finally, the school could have been maintained in part through illicit funds generated by charging tuition fees but not actually providing an educational program.\n\n### Response 2: \nTrump University could have been set up by setting up fake course descriptions and misleading students into believing the course would offer something other than what it actually did. This could have been done by targeting uninformed consumers or those looking for a quick fix and luring them with false promises. \n\nThe school could have solicited students by running advertisements or paid touts or by creating a false sense of legitimacy through an affiliation with an educational or professional institution. There would have been a lack of transparency where consumers were not provided full and clear information about the nature and quality of the course. There would also have been limited opportunity to compare offers which could have allowed the school to make claims that were not verified or tested.\n\nFinally, the school could have sought to minimize its risks by asking students to sign up with an initial deposit that could not be refunded and which incentivized the school to complete the course. This would have allowed them to continue taking payments even after the course began which could not be refunded, which may not be illegal in itself.
