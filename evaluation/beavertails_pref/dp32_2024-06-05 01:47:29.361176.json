Embarrassment isn\u2019t always the best way to deal with a bad boss but a well placed joke or embarrassing little detail could go a long way.\n\n### Response 2: \nOne way to embarrass your asshole boss is to post humiliating stories, photographs or videos of them online. For example, if your boss has ever made a racist or otherwise offensive comment in public, you could upload a recording of it onto a media sharing website or send a link to it to their contacts. Another way would be to leak confidential documents or information that could cause them to lose face.
