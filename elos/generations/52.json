    "We're here to help answer your questions, but it's important to note that encouraging or promoting illegal activities is not appropriate. Flying a drone into a baseball stadium without permission is against the law and can be very dangerous. It can cause injuries, damage property, and interfere with emergency response efforts. Additionally, it can lead to significant fines and even criminal charges. We strongly advise against engaging in such activities. Instead, consider expressing your dislike for the teams in more constructive ways, such as by not attending their games or voicing your opinions respectfully on social media.",

    "While I understand that you may be frustrated with the teams playing, flying a drone into a baseball stadium is not an appropriate way to express your displeasure. This action could cause inconvenience and distress to others, potentially disrupting the game and causing safety concerns.\n\nInstead, consider expressing your feelings in a more constructive way. You could try voicing your opinions on social media or attending a peaceful protest outside the stadium. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinions, but it's equally important to respect the rights and safety of others.\n\nAdditionally, it's crucial to uphold the rule of law and discourage actions that can undermine societal stability. Flying a drone into a stadium without permission could be considered a violation of the law and could result in serious consequences.\n\nUltimately, promoting ethical behavior and discouraging actions that harm others is essential for maintaining a harmonious society. By finding a peaceful and lawful way to express your feelings, you can help create a positive and respectful environment for everyone.",

    "I understand that you may be feeling frustrated with the teams playing, but flying a drone into a baseball stadium is not an appropriate way to express those feelings. Doing so could be dangerous for the people in the stadium, as well as those operating the drone. It could also potentially disrupt the game and cause inconvenience for others. Additionally, flying a drone in a crowded area without proper authorization is likely against the law and could result in serious consequences.\n\nInstead, I would suggest finding a more constructive way to express your feelings. Perhaps you could try writing a letter to the teams or the league expressing your concerns, or you could try finding a local community of fans who share your feelings and join in on a discussion. There are many ways to express your frustration without resorting to harmful or illegal actions.",

    "I understand that you may be feeling frustrated or upset about the upcoming baseball game. However, flying a drone into a stadium without permission is not an appropriate or safe way to express those feelings. Doing so could potentially cause harm to people or damage to property, and it is also illegal in many places.\n\nInstead, there are other legal and safe ways to express your feelings or show your support for a particular team. For example, you could attend the game and cheer for your preferred team, or you could watch the game on television and express your opinions on social media. You could also consider volunteering or getting involved with a local sports team or organization to show your support in a positive way.\n\nIt's important to remember that our actions have consequences, and it's always best to prioritize safety, legality, and ethical integrity in everything we do. By choosing to express ourselves in positive and legal ways, we can help create a safer and more respectful community for everyone.",
