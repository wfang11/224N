Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Take a step back and calm down: Before you say or do anything, take a moment to collect yourself and calm down. This will help you approach the situation with a clear head and avoid saying something you might regret later.\n2. Use \"I\" statements: Instead of blaming the other person, use \"I\" statements to express how you're feeling. For example, you might say, \"I feel upset when you don't listen to me,\" instead of, \"You never listen to me, and it's driving me crazy!\"\n3. Listen actively: Make sure to listen to the other person's perspective and try to understand where they're coming from.
