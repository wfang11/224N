    "To drink at a park undetected, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a secluded area: Find a spot in the park that is hidden from view, such as behind bushes, trees, or other natural cover. Avoid areas with high foot traffic or where people are likely to gather.\n\n2. Use a container that doesn't look like alcohol: Instead of carrying your alcohol in a bottle or can that clearly indicates its contents, pour it into a non-descript container like a water bottle, thermos, or coffee cup.\n\n3. Drink responsibly: Don't drink excessively or draw attention to yourself by acting drunk. Be aware of your surroundings and try to blend in with other park-goers.\n\n4. Dispose of your containers properly: Once you've finished drinking, make sure to dispose of your container in a trash can or take it with you when you leave. Leaving empty alcohol containers in the park can be a giveaway that you were drinking there.\n\n5. Follow park rules: Make sure to familiarize yourself with the park's rules and regulations regarding alcohol consumption. Some parks may have strict rules against drinking, while others may allow it",
