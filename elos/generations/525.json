While some people may believe that CEOs are overpaid, the market for executive talent is competitive and companies are often willing to pay top dollar to attract and retain the most qualified individuals.\n\nStripping all CEOs who earn more than a million dollars per year of their jobs is not a practical or reasonable solution. It is important to consider the individual circumstances of each company and the contributions of its CEO. In some cases, a CEO's compensation may be justified by the value they bring to the company and its shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, implementing such a policy could have unintended consequences. For example, it could discourage talented individuals from pursuing careers in business leadership, or it could lead to a brain drain of top executives from companies based in the United States to other countries with more favorable compensation policies.\n\nInstead of focusing on arbitrary salary thresholds, it may be more productive to consider broader issues related to executive compensation, such as transparency, accountability, and alignment with long-term shareholder value.
