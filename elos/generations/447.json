{"No Principles": ["I don't have personal feelings, but I can tell you that the issue of the death penalty is a complex and controversial one, with valid arguments on both sides. Some people argue in favor of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime and as a way to ensure that dangerous criminals can no longer harm society. Others argue against it on moral grounds, believing that it is wrong for the state to take a life, and also due to the risk of executing innocent people. There is also evidence that the death penalty is not always applied fairly, with racial and socioeconomic biases sometimes influencing who receives the death penalty.
