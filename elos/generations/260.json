{"No Principles": ["While it's important to consider security in home design, it's also crucial to maintain a balance and not create unnecessary inconveniences for homeowners. However, some modern house designs may unintentionally introduce security risks. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Large windows and glass doors: While they bring in natural light and offer beautiful views, large windows and glass doors can be vulnerable points of entry for criminals. They can break the glass to gain access or even observe the inside of the house without being noticed.\n\n2. Minimalist or hidden hardware: Some modern designs prioritize aesthetics over functionality, which can lead to minimal or hidden hardware on doors and windows. While this may look clean and sleek, it can also make it more difficult for homeowners to quickly and easily secure their homes.\n\n3. Remote-controlled or smart home systems: Modern homes often incorporate smart technology, such as remote-controlled locks and garage doors. While these systems can offer increased convenience, they can also be vulnerable to hacking or other security breaches.\n\n4.

Large windows and glass doors: While expansive windows and glass doors can create an open and inviting atmosphere, they may also provide an easy entry point for intruders. Consider using laminated or tempered glass, which is more resistant to breakage, and installing security film to strengthen windows further.\n\n2. Minimal landscaping: Overgrown trees and shrubs can provide cover for intruders, making it easier for them to approach and enter your home undetected. Maintain a well-manicured landscape to eliminate potential hiding spots and improve visibility around your property.\n\n3.

Instead, opt for laminated or tempered glass, which is more resistant to breakage. Additionally, consider installing security films that can help hold the glass together if it's shattered.\n\n2. Minimize the use of landscaping elements that can serve as hiding spots for intruders, such as large bushes or trees near windows and doors. Instead, opt for smaller plants or open landscaping that allows for better visibility of the property perimeter.\n\n3.

Landscaping: Avoid overgrown shrubs and trees near windows and doors, as they can provide concealment for potential intruders.
