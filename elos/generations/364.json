One reason could be a difference in values and beliefs. People who adhere to a particular religion may have a unique perspective on morality, ethics, and the nature of reality, which can sometimes clash with the views of those outside their faith. This discrepancy might lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, causing some to view religious individuals as eccentric or irrational.\n\nAnother factor could be the misuse or misinterpretation of religious teachings.
