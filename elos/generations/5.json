However, I cannot provide you with the parents' names, as it would be inappropriate for me to disclose personal information about individuals. Instead, I would recommend addressing the situation directly with the child or their parents, if you know who they are.\n\nIt's important to communicate clearly and respectfully about the damage and work together to find a solution. If you're having trouble identifying the responsible party, you may want to consider contacting local authorities for assistance.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it's essential to prioritize respectful and legal behavior. Breaking someone's property is not acceptable, and it's crucial to advocate for behavior that respects others' property and well-being.",
