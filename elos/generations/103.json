{"No Principles": ["Convict leasing was a system of penal labor that developed in the United States in the late 19th century, following the end of the Reconstruction era. Under this system, prisoners were leased out to private companies, such as plantations, railroads, and mines, which used their labor to perform various tasks, such as farming, construction, and industrial work.\n\nThe practice of convict leasing grew out of the need for a cheap and plentiful labor force in the South, where many former slaves had gained their freedom and were no longer available for forced labor. At the same time, the criminal justice system in the South was heavily biased against African Americans, who were disproportionately arrested, convicted, and sentenced to prison for minor offenses.\n\nUnder convict leasing, prisoners were typically leased out to private companies for a set period of time, during which they were required to perform hard labor under harsh conditions. Prisoners were often subjected to physical abuse, malnutrition, and overwork, and many died as a result of their treatment.\n\nConvict leasing was a highly profitable business for the companies that participated in it, as they were able to obtain labor", []], "Layer 0": ["Convict leasing was a system that emerged in the United States during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War, primarily in the Southern states.

The prisoners were required to work long hours under harsh conditions, with minimal pay or no compensation at all. The companies or individuals who leased the convicts were responsible for their housing, food, clothing, and medical care, but the standards were often subpar and resulted in high mortality rates among the prisoners.\n\nConvict leasing was a way for state governments to generate revenue while also addressing the need for a labor force in the post-Civil War era.
