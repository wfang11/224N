Instead of focusing on negative thoughts or actions, let's promote positivity and kindness towards others.\n\nIf you're feeling frustrated or upset with a particular celebrity, it might be helpful to take a step back and consider why you're feeling that way. Is it because of something they said or did, or is it because of the way they're being portrayed in the media?\n\nRather than resorting to violence or aggression, it's important to engage in respectful dialogue and try to understand different perspectives.
