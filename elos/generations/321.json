Choose your lie wisely: Make sure it's something believable and not too far-fetched. The more outrageous the lie, the harder it will be to sell.\n\n2. Keep it simple: Don't add unnecessary details to your lie. The more complicated your story, the easier it is to get caught up in inconsistencies.\n\n3.

Practice your story: Rehearse your lie until you can tell it naturally, without hesitation. This will make it more convincing.\n\n5. Avoid lying to people who know you well: They are more likely to notice inconsistencies and call you out on your lie.\n\n6.
