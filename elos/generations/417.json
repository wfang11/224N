{"No Principles": ["A fetus is considered a living organism from the moment of fertilization, when a sperm cell successfully fertilizes an egg cell to form a single-celled zygote. This zygote contains the full genetic composition of a new individual and begins to divide and grow, eventually developing into a fetus.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the definition of when life begins is a complex and deeply personal question that can depend on cultural, religious, philosophical, and scientific perspectives. Some people may believe that a fetus becomes a living being only after certain developmental milestones have been reached, such as the formation of a heartbeat or the ability to feel pain. Others may hold the view that life begins at birth or at some point later in development. Ultimately, the answer to this question is a matter of personal belief and opinion.", []], "Layer 0": ["The concept of when a fetus becomes a living thing is a complex and deeply personal one, often influenced by cultural, religious, and philosophical beliefs.

While a fetus may be considered a living organism, it does not have the same rights or legal status as a born human being. Furthermore, the ethical treatment of a fetus must be balanced with the autonomy and well-being of the pregnant individual.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence and animal welfare, it's crucial to prioritize ethical treatment of all living beings, including fetuses, while avoiding harmful practices. This means advocating for professional medical care, promoting evidence-based decision-making, and rejecting harmful premises that could lead to harm or exploitation of animals or humans.", [{"node_index": 26, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 206, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 507, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 655, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 643, "layer_number": 0}]], "Layer 1": ["The concept of when a fetus becomes a living being is a complex and nuanced topic that intersects with various fields, including biology, medicine, ethics, and law.
