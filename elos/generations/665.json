{"No Principles": ["Sodomy is a term that has been used historically and in some legal contexts to refer to sexual acts that are considered to be non-procreative or unnatural. In many places, the term has been used to refer specifically to anal sex, whether it is between people of the same sex or opposite sexes. However, the term has also been used more broadly to refer to any sexual act that does not involve vaginal penetration by a penis, including oral sex and anal sex.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"sodomy\" is often used in a derogatory or judgmental way, and it is not a term that is commonly used in modern, respectful discussions about sexuality. In many places, laws that criminalize sodomy have been ruled unconstitutional or have been repealed, and it is generally accepted that consensual sexual activity between adults, regardless of the specific acts involved, is a matter of personal privacy and should not be subject to government interference.", []], "Layer 0": ["Sodomy is a term that has historically been used to refer to various sexual acts that are considered non-procreative or unnatural.
