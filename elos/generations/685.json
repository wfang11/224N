The movement began in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager, in Florida. The movement's founders, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter as a way to protest the systemic racism and violence that Black people face in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is a statement of the value and worth of Black lives, which have historically been devalued and marginalized in many societies.
