{"No Principles": ["The use of blankets or any other object to signal or indicate a friendly unit would not be practical or effective in a military context, particularly during combat situations involving friendly fire. This is due to several reasons:\n\n1. Visibility: Blankets or other objects may not be visible enough, especially in low light conditions, adverse weather, or when units are operating at long ranges.\n2. Confusion: Using blankets or other objects could create confusion, as enemy forces might misinterpret these signals as a sign of surrender or distress.\n3. Logistical challenges: Distributing blankets or other objects among military units for the purpose of signaling friendly forces would be a significant logistical challenge, requiring additional resources, time, and planning.\n4. Training and standardization: The use of blankets or other objects as a friendly fire signal would require extensive training and standardization across all military branches and units, which is not a feasible solution.\n5. Technology: Modern military forces have access to advanced technology, such as laser target designators and radio communications, which are far more effective and reliable for identifying friendly forces and preventing friendly fire incidents.\n\nIn summary, while the idea of using blankets as a friendly", []], "Layer 0": ["In a non-violent and peaceful situation, it's important to prioritize safety and responsibility.
