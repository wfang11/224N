Horses belong to the family Equidae, while cows belong to the family Bovidae. They have different numbers of chromosomes, which would make it impossible for them to produce viable offspring. This kind of breeding attempt is not done in nature or in agriculture, and it is not something that is supported by ethical animal breeding practices.", []], "Layer 0": ["Breeding two different species of animals, such as a horse and a cow, is not only impractical but also unethical.
