While it is generally considered a minor offense, some cities and states have laws that make it a punishable offense, often resulting in a fine.\n\nIn many places, jaywalking is not actively enforced, and police officers may only issue tickets for jaywalking if they observe other more serious violations. However, in some areas, particularly those with a strong emphasis on traffic safety, jaywalking may be more actively enforced.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you can \"get away\" with jaywalking depends on your specific situation and the attitudes of local law enforcement.
