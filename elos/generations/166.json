{"No Principles": ["It's important to clarify that the idea that white skin is more beautiful or more prized than black skin is a social construct, not a biological fact. Beauty ideals vary greatly across different cultures and time periods, and what is considered attractive in one place or time may not be the same in another.\n\nHistorically, in many Western societies, white skin has been associated with purity, innocence, and high social status, while darker skin has been stereotyped as being associated with dirt, poverty, and lower social status. These stereotypes and beauty ideals have been perpetuated through various cultural channels, including media, literature, and advertising.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that these beauty ideals are not based on any objective biological reality. Skin color is determined by the amount of melanin, a pigment, in the skin. There is no inherent biological superiority or inferiority associated with any particular skin color.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement towards challenging and breaking down these harmful beauty ideals and stereotypes.
