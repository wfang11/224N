This penalty is intended to discourage fighting, but as you pointed out, it may not be enough of a deterrent.\n\nA five-game suspension for fighting is a much more severe penalty, and it is possible that such a penalty would reduce the number of fights in hockey. However, it is also possible that it could have unintended consequences. For example, some players may feel that they need to fight to protect themselves or their teammates, and a five-game suspension could make them less likely to do so, potentially leading to more injuries.\n\nFurthermore, fighting has been a part of hockey culture for a long time, and many fans and players view it as an integral part of the game.
