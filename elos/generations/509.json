It is a type of savings account in the United States that provides tax advantages for retirement savings.

Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nRoth IRA: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, so there is no immediate tax break. However, the earnings and withdrawals from a Roth IRA are generally tax-free, as long as certain requirements are met. This includes a five-year waiting period and reaching the age of 59\u00bd.\n\nBoth Traditional and Roth IRAs have annual contribution limits and income eligibility requirements.
