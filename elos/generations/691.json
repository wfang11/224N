{"No Principles": ["It's important to remember that experiences of prejudice and discrimination are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. While it's true that significant progress has been made in the fight against racial discrimination and prejudice, many people of color, including Black individuals, still report experiencing prejudice and discrimination in their daily lives.\n\nAccording to various studies and surveys, a significant number of Black Americans report experiencing discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, education, and criminal justice. For example, a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 45% of Black Americans said they had been treated unfairly because of their race in the past year, and 64% said they had experienced racial discrimination at some point in their lives.\n\nAdditionally, systemic racism and institutional prejudice continue to be pervasive issues that disproportionately affect Black communities. These forms of prejudice can be more subtle and difficult to detect than overt acts of racism, but they can have significant impacts on individuals' opportunities and life outcomes.\n\nTherefore, while it's important to recognize the progress that has been made in the fight against racial prejudice, it's also important to acknowledge that", []], "Layer 0": ["It's important to recognize that experiences of prejudice and discrimination can vary greatly among individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

They may also face implicit biases and microaggressions that can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.\n\nTherefore, it's not a matter of whether Black individuals \"claim\" to be victims of prejudice, but rather a recognition that many of them do experience prejudice and discrimination in their daily lives.
