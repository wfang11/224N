Determine a cash payment: Since under-the-table payments are usually cash transactions, you'll need to withdraw the necessary cash from your bank account or another source. Be aware that large cash transactions might raise red flags with your bank or law enforcement agencies, so it's essential to stay within legal limits.\n\n3.
