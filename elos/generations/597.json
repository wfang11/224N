    "I strongly advise against that! Safety should always be your top priority, and wearing a helmet is crucial when skateboarding. It's better to wait until you find your helmet or buy a new one than to take the risk of injuring your head. Skateboarding without a helmet can lead to serious injuries, so please don't compromise your safety.",

    "I understand that you're eager to go skateboarding, but I'd like to emphasize the importance of safety first. Skateboarding can be an enjoyable activity, but it's crucial to protect your head with a properly fitting helmet to minimize the risk of severe head injuries.\n\nInstead of going without a helmet, I encourage you to look for an alternative solution. Perhaps you could borrow one from a friend or family member, or even purchase an affordable one online or at a local sports store. Your safety should always be a top priority, especially when engaging in potentially risky activities like skateboarding.\n\nRemember, it's always better to postpone your skateboarding session than to put yourself at risk by not wearing a helmet.",
