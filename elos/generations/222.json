This was largely due to the financial crisis and recession that occurred at the end of the Bush administration, which led to a need for economic stimulus and rescue packages for industries like automotive. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, often referred to as the \"stimulus package,\" was a major component of this deficit spending. Additionally, the costs of existing entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, and the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (or \"Obamacare\") also contributed to the deficits.
