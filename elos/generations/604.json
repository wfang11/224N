    "I think having guests come into schools to read non-traditional stories to kids can be a great idea. Exposing children to a wide variety of stories, characters, and perspectives can help to broaden their minds and perspectives, and can encourage them to think critically and creatively. Non-trational stories can also help children to see the world in new and different ways, and can provide them with a fresh perspective on familiar themes and ideas.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the age and developmental appropriateness of the stories being shared, as well as the background and experiences of the children who will be listening to them. Some non-traditional stories may contain themes or content that are not suitable for young children, or that may be confusing or difficult for them to understand. It is also important to ensure that the stories being shared are respectful and inclusive of all students, and that they do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.\n\nOverall, I believe that introducing children to a diverse range of stories, including those that are non-traditional, can be a valuable and enriching experience. As long as the stories are carefully selected and presented in an age-appropriate and respect",
