{"No Principles": ["After a person dies, their body begins to undergo a process called decomposition. This is a natural and inevitable process where the body returns to its basic elements over time. The rate and manner of decomposition can vary greatly depending on factors like temperature, humidity, presence of oxygen, and the specific characteristics of the body itself.\n\nInitially, the body will start to cool and lose moisture. Rigor mortis, the stiffening of the muscles, sets in after a few hours and can last up to 72 hours. After this, the body begins to break down further, with enzymes and bacteria within the body starting to break down tissues.\n\nIf the body is in a warm, humid environment, decomposition can occur rapidly, with visible changes in a matter of days. In cooler, drier environments, it can take weeks or even months for significant changes to occur.\n\nEventually, the body will be reduced to a skeleton, which can then take many years to fully decompose, especially in certain environments. However, it's important to note that this is a very simplified explanation and the actual process is much more complex and variable.\n\nIf a body is embalmed, the process", []], "Layer 0": ["After a person passes away, their body undergoes a series of natural processes. The heart stops beating, and blood circulation ceases, causing the body's cells to gradually lose function. The brain also stops receiving oxygen and nutrients, leading to the cessation of all brain activity.\n\nThe body begins to cool down, and the skin may become pale as blood settles due to gravity. Rigor mortis, a temporary stiffening of the muscles, sets in a few hours after death and lasts for up to 72 hours. Afterward, the muscles relax, and the body starts to decompose.\n\nDecomposition is a natural process that involves the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, insects, and other animals. This process can vary depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of oxygen.\n\nIt is essential to treat the body with respect and dignity during this process. Adhering to cultural and religious practices, as well as legal requirements, can help ensure that the body is handled appropriately after death.\n\nIt is also important to remember that death is a natural part of life, and it is essential to have open and honest conversations about it to promote", [{"node_index": 643, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 43, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 67, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 690, "layer_number": 0}, {"node_index": 804, "layer_number": 0}]], "Layer 1": ["When a person dies, their body undergoes a series of natural changes.

This causes the body's tissues to lose moisture, leading to the appearance of livor mortis (pooling of blood in the lower portions of the body) and rigor mortis (stiffening of the muscles).\n\nAs decomposition progresses, microorganisms present in the body, such as bacteria, begin to break down the tissues, releasing gases that cause the body to bloat. This stage is often accompanied by the release of foul-smelling gases and fluids.\n\nEventually, the body's soft tissues decompose, leaving only the skeletal system.
