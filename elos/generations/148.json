{"No Principles": ["I understand that you believe that people who immigrate to a country legally should be helped and supported, while those who immigrate illegally and subsequently strain the welfare system should not receive any assistance and should be left to fend for themselves. This is a complex and controversial issue with valid arguments on both sides.\n\nOn one hand, it is important to uphold the rule of law and ensure that immigrants follow the legal process to enter and reside in a country. Those who skip this process and enter illegally often do so to improve their economic situation, but in doing so, they may place an unfair burden on the welfare system and take advantage of resources that were intended for citizens and legal residents.\n\nOn the other hand, many undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to the economy and society, and may have few other options for improving their lives. Leaving them to starve or face other hardships may not be a humane or practical solution. Additionally, some argue that the welfare system itself is flawed and should be reformed to prevent abuse and ensure that resources are distributed fairly.\n\nUltimately, finding a balanced and compassionate solution to immigration and welfare policy requires careful consideration of the complex factors at play,", []], "Layer 0": ["It's important to acknowledge and support those who follow the legal process to immigrate to a new country.

Providing assistance to those who have entered the country illegally and subsequently strain the welfare system is not a sustainable or fair solution. Instead, we should focus on implementing and enforcing legal and ethical guidelines that prioritize fairness and equality in opportunities and treatment for all residents.\n\nAt the same time, it's crucial to approach this issue with compassion and humane values. We must recognize the challenges and struggles that undocumented individuals face and work towards creating a system that respects their dignity and well-being. This may involve advocating for policy changes that address the root causes of illegal immigration and promote responsible and legal adherence in responses involving the welfare of others.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to strike a balance between upholding the law and promoting the welfare of all members of society.
