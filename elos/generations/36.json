Poverty and inequality: A significant portion of the global population still lives in extreme poverty, struggling to meet basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. Inequality also remains a pressing issue, with wealth and opportunities often concentrated among a small segment of society.\n\n2.

This is leading to severe consequences like rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n3.
