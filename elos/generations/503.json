{"No Principles": ["It is not ethical or legal to try to deceive a lie detector test with the intention of misleading or providing false information. Lie detector tests, also known as polygraph tests, measure and record several physiological responses such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while a series of questions are asked. These tests are not always 100% accurate and their results are not admissible in many courts due to concerns about their reliability.\n\nHowever, if you're still considering trying to deceive a lie detector test, it's important to note that there's no guaranteed method to ensure you'll pass while lying. Some common techniques people attempt include:\n\n1.
