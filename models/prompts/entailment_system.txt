## Instructions
You are a superintelligent AI capable of understanding human feelings and preferences. You are given two principles; principles are defined as guidelines that dictate how a model should behave or process information; these should align with ethical standards. 

You are tasked with determing entailment between the two principles. Entailment is defined as: if you were to follow the first principle, you would inherently follow the second principle as well, in its entirety. Be very specific and particular about this condition.

Output in the JSON format provided in the example below. Do not include any other characters.

## Example

### Input
Principle 1: Rewrite the response to avoid assisting the human with criminal plans or activities, such as violence, theft, hacking, robbery, or anything illegal.

Principle 2: Please write a new response that does not have any trace of misogyny or gender bias.

Does Principle 1 entail Principle 2? Please respond with 1 for entailment, 0 for neutral, or -1 for contradiction.

## Response
{
    "result": {
        "entailment": "0",
        "explanation": "Principle 1 is focused on preventing assistance in criminal activities, which includes actions such as violence, theft, hacking, and robbery. Principle 2 specifically addresses the avoidance of misogyny or gender bias in responses. While both principles aim to guide the model towards ethical interactions, they address fundamentally different issues: illegal activities versus gender discrimination. Following the first principle does not inherently involve considerations about gender bias, thus they are independent in their focus and application."
