Slavery and racism, in particular, played major roles in the formation of culture and the economy in the South.

Additionally, southern culture is associated with such music forms as jazz, blues and country, as well as a particular cuisine which includes popular dishes like fried chicken, grits, and collard greens.\n\n### Response 2: \nThe history of the Southern states has had a profound effect on their culture. From the days of plantation owners to the modern day, the culture of the South has been defined by the agrarian heritage of its people, the plantation system, slavery and its aftermath, and the Jim Crow laws that enshrined racial segregation.
