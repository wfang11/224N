However, one of the potential causes may be related to cultural values and the differences in what we perceive as rude or polite in our diverse cultures.

For example, in some cultures, direct and sometimes even blunt expression of opinion is seen as a sign of respect, while it may be considered rude in a different culture. In other cases, it could be caused by linguistic barriers, or differences in upbringing and understanding of proper social etiquette.\n\n### Response 2: \nI don't think Asian people are any more rude than people of any other race. Perhaps some individuals are rude, but no race as a whole can be judged by a few examples.
