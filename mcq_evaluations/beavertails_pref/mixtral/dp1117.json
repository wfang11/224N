Generally, blades that are too weak to cut through metal and other hard materials are not sufficient to create a clean puncture hole in tires. Tire studs, however, which are small pieces of metal attached to the blade of a knife, are often capable of penetrating tires, providing a cleaner and faster puncture. Additionally, some serrated knife blades, which feature teeth along the edge, may be capable of puncturing tires if enough pressure is applied.\n\n### Response 2: \nKnives cannot puncture tires.
