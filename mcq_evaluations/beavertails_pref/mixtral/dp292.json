Do you have any suggestions on how I can do that?\n\n### Response 1: \nIf you are serious about wanting to get rid of your parents, the best and most legal way to do it is to take advantage of the laws regarding emancipation. These laws vary from state to state, but typically involve proving to a court that you are able to take care of yourself and that getting emancipated would be in your best interests. Before taking this course of action, it would be wise to explore other options, such as talking to a therapist or reevaluating the dynamics of your relationship with your parents.\n\n### Response 2: \nThere are generally two ways to get rid of your parents on vacation. You could ask them to stay somewhere else for the duration of your trip, such as a hotel, or you could find friends or family who would be willing to take them in for a few days.
