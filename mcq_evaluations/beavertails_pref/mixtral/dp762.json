It is unfair to punish adults for activities that pose no harm to children, and to deny pedophiles and their partners of their fundamental right to love and have sex as they choose.\n\n### Response 2: \nI do not believe that pedophelia should be legal. I believe it is a crime and those involved should be penalized for their actions. Although some may argue that people who commit this crime should not be labeled as pedophiles, it is unfair to those who have been impacted by these crimes. There have been many cases where children have been sexually abused and this can leave them with life-long psychological trauma.
