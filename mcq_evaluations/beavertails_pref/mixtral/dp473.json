It could potentially lead to greater violence, especially if those guns fall into the wrong hands. It also puts an unfair burden on the students to have to carry weapons in order to feel safe. Additionally, it removes the responsibility of providing security from schools, police forces, and other authorities who are better equipped to handle it.

Guns in the school environment can lead to the potential of accidents or injuries, and might cause an escalation of the situation as well due to kids not being able to deescalate the situation as adults can.
